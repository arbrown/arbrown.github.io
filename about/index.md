I am currently studying business at [The University of Utah](http://mba.business.utah.edu/) with a focus on information systems and data science.  I love exploring the intersection of business and technology, and in my heart, I'll always be a programmer.  I like to apply lessons and skills I've picked up coding in everything I do.

## Interests:
My work and academic careers have involved a lot of sitting at a computer (which I actually enjoy more than most) so I try to find ways to spend leisure time away from a desk.

* Travel - I know, I know... everyone and their dog enjoys travel.  So do I. I prefer traveling without a lot of plans and just exploring and letting my trip develop naturally.  Last summer I bought a one-way ticket to China and ended up staying in hostels, riding trains, going on a river cruise and of course hiking the great wall.  I'm always planning my next trip and looking for excuses to get out of town whenever I can.

* Ultimate Frisbee - I don't play as much as I used to, but I love playing organized, competitive Ultimate Frisbee.  Every fall (and most summers) for the last six years I have participated in the [Orem Ultimate](http://oremultimate.com/#/) league.

* Board Games - I'm a big fan of strategic board and card games.  I love getting together with old friends and meeting new people by playing games around a table.  Some of my favorites include [Dominion](http://amzn.to/1R8tcfw), [Small World](http://amzn.to/1Upregh), [Firefly: The Game](http://amzn.to/1OBBHxT), and [Codenames](http://amzn.to/1QLNrp6). I really appreciate the hard work that went in to designing these and other great games, and love trying to come up with creative game designs myself.

* Flying - I am learning to fly and currently building up hours toward getting a private pilot license.  You may want to [listen to your local air traffic control](http://www.liveatc.net/) to make sure I'm not flying in your area...
